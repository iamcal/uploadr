
What the heck is up with these JARs?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The JARs in this directory are for XULRunner internal strings - stuff 
like the extension manager, the automatic update service, etc.


XULRunner doesn't yet ship with non en-US locales for these JARs

To build the XULRunner locale JARs, we simply take the locale JAR 
from http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/l10n-mozilla-1.9.1/de/file/cbdd8d9a167d/toolkit/chrome/
or for en-Us:
C:\mozilla\toolkit\locales\en-US\chrome if you got the source code from hg as mentionned in Readme.updates

We then take only the folders inside the
'locale/ko' folder (for Korean) and copy them into our SVN tree
at '/xulrunner_locales/locale/ko-kr/'. The build script (build.pl)
will do the magic to package them all up and create the manifest.

At this time, we're including locale file from Firefox 3.1 Beta 2. When
Firefox goes GA, we'll probably want to update these files 
accordingly to catch any changes.



Locale mappings
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Flickr and Mozilla locales don't overlap exactly. Here's how we're 
currently mapping them.

	Flickr   <->	Moz 

	de-de		de
	en-US		en-US
	es-us		es-ES
	fr-fr		fr
	it-it		it
	ko-kr		ko
	pt-br		pt-BR
	zh-hk		zh-TW

	ja-jp		ja
