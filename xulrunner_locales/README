
What the heck is up with these JARs?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The JARs in this directory are for XULRunner internal strings - stuff 
like the extension manager, the automatic update service, etc.

XULRunner doesn't yet ship with non en-US locales for these JARs, but
it's not as bad as it was, since Firefox 3 Beta 5 ships with 
everything we need, plus some other junk.

To build the XULRunner locale JARs, we simply take the locale JAR 
from a Firefox 3 install, e.g.

	C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox 3\chrome\ko.jar

We then unpack the JAR and take only the folders inside the
'locale/ko' folder (for Korean) and copy them into our SVN tree
at '/xulrunner_locales/locale/ko-kr/'. The build script (build.pl)
will do the magic to package them all up and create the manifest.

At this time, we're including locale file from Firefox 3 Beta 5. When
Firefox goes GA, we'll probably want to update these files 
accordingly to catch any changes.



Locale mappings
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Flickr and Mozilla locales don't overlap exactly. Here's how we're 
currently mapping them.

	Flickr   <->	Moz 

	de-de		de
	en-US		en-US
	es-us		es-ES
	fr-fr		fr
	it-it		it
	ko-kr		ko
	pt-br		pt-BR
	zh-hk		zh-TW

	ja-jp		ja
