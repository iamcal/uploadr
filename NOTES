NOTES

Expand gm.thumb to return the date taken as well for use in sorting
	MySQL format would be nice, as that is string-sortable

Offer a preference to not create thumbnails in the name of speed
	Accomplish this with special case param of thumbSize = 0 to gm.thumb
	This will still return the date taken but will not actually do the thumbing

As of 8-21-2007
	Thumbing 127 8 MP JPEGs

Make sure it's smart when network drops
*** Partial batch tagging - tag a >1 photo selection all at once - append to individual tags
Tooltips on toolbar buttons
Save state of unuploaded photos on exit
Tabs for batches (two total - the uploading batch and the editing batch)
	When you start upload, create a new tab for the next batch
	jUploadr/Chronic style photo progress indication
	User must DO SOMETHING to get to the new batch once uploading starts (button to switch tabs)
Ordering options instead of a default
	Date taken (fallback to alpha if date taken not available)
	Let me order them
	Reverse the current thing

Twiki page!

Look into embedding Flash into the Uploadr - Picnik



Drag selecting photos
	I couldn't figure out any way other than hardcoding the offsets to make the box actually
	track the cursor.  document.getElementById('photos').offsetTop isn't set?!
