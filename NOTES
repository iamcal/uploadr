NOTES

Expand gm.thumb to return the date taken as well for use in sorting
	MySQL format would be nice, as that is string-sortable

Offer a preference to not create thumbnails in the name of speed
	Accomplish this with special case param of thumbSize = 0 to gm.thumb
	This will still return the date taken but will not actually do the thumbing
