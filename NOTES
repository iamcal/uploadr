NOTES

Expand gm.thumb to return the date taken as well for use in sorting
	MySQL format would be nice, as that is string-sortable

Offer a preference to not create thumbnails in the name of speed
	Accomplish this with special case param of thumbSize = 0 to gm.thumb
	This will still return the date taken but will not actually do the thumbing

As of 8-21-2007
	Thumbing 127 8 MP JPEGs
		Uploadr 3 Mac		97 seconds

Make sure it's smart when network drops
*** Partial batch tagging - tag a >1 photo selection all at once - append to individual tags
Tooltips on toolbar buttons
Save state of unuploaded photos on exit
Tabs for batches (two total - the uploading batch and the editing batch)
	When you start upload, create a new tab for the next batch
	jUploadr/Chronic style photo progress indication
	User must DO SOMETHING to get to the new batch once uploading starts (button to switch tabs)
Ordering options instead of a default
	Date taken (fallback to alpha if date taken not available)
	Let me order them
	Reverse the current thing

Twiki page!

Look into embedding Flash into the Uploadr - Picnik



Drag selecting photos
	I couldn't figure out any way other than hardcoding the offsets to make the box actually
	track the cursor.  document.getElementById('photos').offsetTop isn't set?!

Partial batch metadata
	Overwrite titles always
	Append to description always (prefix with \n\n)
		Could have a pref for append/overwrite for description - nah
	Confirmation on clicking save
	*** Make blank title or description not overwrite each photo ***
		Do all partial batches like the changed_* checks in settings.js
	"Leave unchanged" checkbox for privacy metadata that unchecks if they change something
Re-adding to a batch after failure
	Preserve order in the queue, which is the order they wanted
Add add-to-set option for each photo and for partial batches
Nix the per-photo resize options
